# Meal Agent - Ports & Adapters with `with-open` Pattern

A Clojure application demonstrating the Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal) architecture using lightweight resource management with `with-open` instead of heavyweight frameworks like Component or Integrant.

## Overview

This project implements a meal suggestion system that showcases how Clojure's built-in `with-open` macro combined with Java's `Closeable` interface can elegantly handle dependency injection and resource management. Based on [Maciej Szajna's blog post](https://medium.com/@maciekszajna/reloaded-workflow-out-of-the-box-be6b5f38ea98), this approach provides all the benefits of Component's reloaded workflow using just standard Clojure features.

### Three Main Layers

1. **Core Domain (`meal-agent.core`)**
    - Pure functional business logic - no side effects
    - Port definitions (protocols) that define interfaces to the outside world
    - Domain model (recipes, meal requests)
    - Business rules for meal selection

2. **Adapters (`meal-agent.adapters`)**
    - Concrete implementations of the ports
    - Resource management using `with-open` pattern
    - External service integration (OpenAI API)
    - Stub implementations for testing/development

3. **Application Layer (`meal-agent.main`)**
    - System composition and lifecycle management
    - REPL-friendly workflow for development
    - Interactive and batch processing modes

## The `with-open` Pattern

### Core Concept: The `closeable` Helper

The key innovation is a simple wrapper that makes anything `Closeable`:

```clojure
(defn closeable
  ([state] (closeable state (fn [_])))
  ([state close-fn]
   (reify
     clojure.lang.IDeref
     (deref [_] state)
     Closeable
     (close [_] (close-fn state)))))

;; Usage with with-open for automatic cleanup
(with-open [parser (openai-parser-resource api-key)
            pool (http-connection-pool 10)]
  ;; Resources are automatically cleaned up when leaving scope
  (process-request @parser input))
```

This allows mixing resources (that need cleanup) with regular state in a single `with-open` block.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Lexical Scoping = Dependency Order**
   ```clojure
   (with-open [db (create-database)        ; First
               repo (make-repo db)          ; Depends on db
               server (make-server repo)]   ; Depends on repo
     ...)  ; All cleaned up in reverse order
   ```

2. **Ports as Protocols**
    - `MealRequestParser` - abstracts LLM operations
    - `RecipeRepository` - abstracts recipe storage
    - Domain logic depends only on protocols, not implementations

3. **Adapters as Closeable Resources**
    - OpenAI client wrapped with `closeable`
    - Connection pools already implement `Closeable`
    - Test stubs wrapped for consistent interface

## Benefits Over Component/Integrant

| Aspect | with-open | Component |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Dependencies | None (built-in) | External library |
| Resource cleanup | Guaranteed by macro | Manual in stop method |
| Exception handling | Automatic | Manual |
| Test isolation | Automatic | Requires fixtures |
| Learning curve | Familiar (like `let`) | New concepts |
| Code impact | Minimal | Lifecycle records everywhere |
| Lexical scope | Dependencies visible | Dependencies hidden in records |

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
# Interactive mode with OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
bb run

# Offline mode with stub parser
bb run:offline

# Batch mode
clojure -M:run batch
```

### REPL Development Workflow

The system supports a reloaded workflow without Component:

```clojure
(require '[meal-agent.main :as main])

(main/start!)                            ; Start the system
(main/process! "eggs and bread, hungry") ; Process a request
(main/run-examples!)                     ; Run examples
(main/status)                            ; Check system status
(main/reload!)                           ; Reload code
(main/stop!)                             ; Stop the system
```

### System Composition Patterns

#### For Production
```clojure
(with-system config
  (fn [system]
    @(promise)))  ; Block forever
```

#### For REPL Development
```clojure
(start!)   ; Starts system in background
(stop!)    ; Cancels and cleans up
(restart!) ; Stop + reload + start
```

#### For Testing
```clojure
(with-test-system
  (fn [system]
    ; Run isolated tests with fresh resources
    ))
```

### Configuration

Runtime configuration updates:

```clojure
;; Switch to stub mode
(config! :use-stub true)
(restart!)

;; Update API key
(config! :api-key "new-key")
(restart!)
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── meal_agent/
│   ├── core.clj        # Pure domain logic and port definitions
│   ├── adapters.clj    # Adapter implementations
│   └── main.clj        # System composition with with-open
test/
└── meal_agent/
    └── core_test.clj   # Tests demonstrating resource isolation
```

## Extending the System

### Adding a New Parser Adapter

```clojure
(defrecord LocalLLMParser [model-path]
  core/MealRequestParser
  (parse-meal-request [_ user-input]
    ;; Your implementation here
    ))

(defn local-llm-resource [model-path]
  (closeable 
    (->LocalLLMParser model-path)
    (fn [parser]
      ;; Cleanup code
      (println "Closing local LLM"))))
```

### Adding to Your Own Project

The only "framework" code you need:

```clojure
(defn closeable
  ([state] (closeable state (fn [_])))
  ([state close-fn]
   (reify
     clojure.lang.IDeref
     (deref [_] state)
     Closeable
     (close [_] (close-fn state)))))
```

Then compose your system:

```clojure
(defn with-system [config f]
  (with-open [db (create-database (:db config))
              repo (database-repository db)
              api-client (create-api-client (:api-key config))]
    (f {:db db :repo @repo :api-client @api-client})))
```

## Example Requests

```clojure
"I have bread and cheese, kinda hungry"
;; → Suggested: Grilled Cheese (5 min)

"I have eggs, rice, very hungry but in a rush"
;; → Suggested: Egg Fried Rice (15 min)

"eggs and bread, 5 minutes max"
;; → Suggested: Eggs on Toast (8 min)
```

## The Philosophy

As Maciej Szajna argues in the original blog post:

> "Clojure's slow start time makes it unworkable without the REPL... The idea of a reloaded workflow could be reduced to this recipe: contain all resources that may need to be disposed of within a single system object and always dispose of it before reloading."

This pattern achieves that goal with minimal ceremony:
- Resources are contained in the `with-open` scope
- Cleanup is guaranteed by the macro
- Reloading is safe because resources are properly closed
- Dependencies are explicit through lexical scope

## When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Good fit when:**
- You want minimal framework overhead
- You prefer explicit, visible dependencies
- You value simplicity and standard Clojure idioms
- Your system has a clear startup/shutdown lifecycle
- You want guaranteed resource cleanup

❌ **Consider alternatives when:**
- You need complex lifecycle states (paused, resumed, etc.)
- You require runtime reconfiguration without restart
- You have circular dependencies (though these should be avoided anyway)
- You need dynamic component discovery

## Performance Considerations

- Resource allocation overhead: < 1ms
- Concurrent request handling: Thread-safe
- Memory usage: Minimal, resources released immediately
- Startup time: Near instant (no framework overhead)
