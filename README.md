Fintan
======

Fintan is a free, open-source Clojure library for building auditable, composable LLM agents with data‑first design, structured observability, and pluggable reasoning.

> Name: “Fintan” after Fintan mac Bóchra (“the Wise”), the mythic seer who survives the flood and remembers all histories — a fitting patron for deliberate, memory‑aware agents. (Wikipedia)
