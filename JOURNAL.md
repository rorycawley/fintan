I'm clarifying what an agent is. Reading [simple python decision agent](https://www.anupshinde.com/simple-decision-agent-python/) I can see that an agent is something that can *Observe* its environment, *Think* based on rules or logic and *Act* to solve a problem or achieve a goal.

Non-LLM agents don't understand natural language and cannot adapt or learn. On the other hand, LLM agents can cope with vague natural language requests although the results aren't fully predictable. LLM agents can ask follow up questions to clarify the request and that can lead to better results.

Reading [LLM-Powered Agent](https://www.anupshinde.com/llm-powered-agent-python/) I can see the benefits of having an LLM at the core.
