I'm clarifying what an agent is. Reading [simple python decision agent](https://www.anupshinde.com/simple-decision-agent-python/) I can see that an agent is something that can *Observe* its environment, *Think* based on rules or logic and *Act* to solve a problem or achieve a goal.

Non-LLM agents don't understand natural language and cannot adapt or learn. On the other hand, LLM agents can cope with vague natural language requests although the results aren't fully predictable.
